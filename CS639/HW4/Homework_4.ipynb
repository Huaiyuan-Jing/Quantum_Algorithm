Since the only source of non-Cliffordness in QAOA is the axial rotations, we first count the number of $R_z$ ($R_x = HR_zH$) gates we need to synthesize in a 10-layer QAOA solving a MaxCut problem with a 100-node 3-regular graph. Then we multiply the number of $R_z$ gates by the rough number of $T$ gates we estimated in Part A for a given $\\epsilon$.\n",
