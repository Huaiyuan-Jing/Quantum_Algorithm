    "# Q4: Gridsynth [2 Points]\n",
    "Gridsynth is the state-of-the-art (ancilla-free, deterministic) synthesis algorithm to approximate Rz gates with Clifford + T. Gridsynth leverages insights from number theory to achieve optimal or near-optimal approximations for any desired error threshold $\\epsilon$. By optimal, we mean the saturation of the T count lower bound given an $\\epsilon$, which you will explore in Part A."

Then we multiply the number of $R_z$ gates by the rough number of $T$ gates we estimated in Part A for a given $\\epsilon$.\n",
