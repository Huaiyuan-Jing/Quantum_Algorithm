    "# Q4: Gridsynth [2 Points]\n",
    "Gridsynth is the state-of-the-art (ancilla-free, deterministic) synthesis algorithm to approximate Rz gates with Clifford + T. Gridsynth leverages insights from number theory to achieve optimal or near-optimal approximations for any desired error threshold $\\epsilon$. By optimal, we mean the saturation of the T count lower bound given an $\\epsilon$, which you will explore in Part A."

In this part, you will use a Python implementation of gridsynth to synthesize random Rz gates at different $\\epsilon$ to fit $a$ and $b$."

    "Now let's estimate the number of T gates needed for executing a QAOA circuit fault-tolerantly. Since the only source of non-Cliffordness in QAOA is the axial rotations, we first count the number of $R_z$ ($R_x = HR_zH$) gates we need to synthesize in a 10-layer QAOA solving a MaxCut problem with a 100-node 3-regular graph. Then we multiply the number of $R_z$ gates by the rough number of $T$ gates we estimated in Part A for a given $\\epsilon$.\n",
